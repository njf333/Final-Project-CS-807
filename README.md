<h1><b> Hand Gesture Controlled computer </h1></b>

<p> The project is focused on implementing the technique to control computer using hand gestures. The concept behind Arduino-based Gesture maintained computer is simple
and is implemented using Python. The principle here uses 2 Ultrasonic sensors with Arduino and the central part is the position of the ultrasonic sensors. It works by placing our hands in front of the ultrasonic sensor and then calculating the distance between the hand and the sensor. The computer uses this information to perform relevant actions. The positioning of ultrasonic sensors is the most crucial part here. The project proposal focuses on making modifications to the existing project,
implementing multiple gestures to control computer actions.
